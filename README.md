# Numerical
This will contain a collection of Ada (and possibly lisp, if I get really ambitious) packages for numerical operations.

A rough outline of what I plan is below.  Obviously, this will be subject to change.  I expect that most, if not all
of these packages will be generic so that they can be used on different numerical types.

##  Complex Numbers

##  Integration

##  Differentiation

##  Differential Equations

##  Root Finding

##  Vectors

##  Matrices

##  Quaternions
